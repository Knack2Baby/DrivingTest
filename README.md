# DrivingTest
This java program was made by me in order to practice questions for an upcoming driving exam I had.
The program contains 30 questions and asks 10 of those questions randomly without repeating any questions.
After each question it will allow the user to answer the question by using the keyboard.
The program will check if the user input matches the appropriate answer which is stored in a String.
If the user input matches or doesn't match the appropriate answer it will print out an appropriate message.
At the end the program will give a score out of ten depending on how many answers were correct and will store the score and the time that score was achieved in a seperate text file named "results.txt"
